# ðŸ’¼ What will we be building?

We will be building a static portfolio in HTML/CSS! You will come out of this mini-tutorial with something useful you can further enhance to use as your portfolio to recruiters and potential employers.

## We have split the project into four parts

1. [Creating `index.html`](part-1/README.md)
2. [Designing & building a wireframe](part-2/README.md)
3. [Adding CSS & implementing responsive web design](part-3/README.md)
4. [Adding advanced styling](part-4/README.md)
