# Database Basics

Consider all the organizations you've registered with in your lifetime. They probably range from non-essential services like Facebook and Reddit, to much more important ones such as banking and education. Regardless of what you signed up for, it's a guarantee that your personal information has been stored by the company somewhere. And it doesn't just stop with registration data. Sports teams keep track of player statistics, shops record daily transactions, there are infinite applications of the kinds of data we might be interested in saving for future access and analysis. As you might have guessed, the most popular storage medium used to accomplish this are **databases**.

## Why do we need databases?

Databases are more than just storage containers for data. If that's all they were capable of, there would be little reason to choose a formal database over something like a spreadsheet. However, databases were designed to solve important issues with data collection and maintenance that traditional storage mediums don't always address. Here are some of the main reasons we love databases:

### Efficient Storage
Databases are able to store an enormous number of records in very little space. Unlike spreadsheets, databases do not have record limitations.

### Data Integrity
Data integrity describes the accuracy and consistency of your data. One of the most prevalent issues with using spreadsheets is how easy it is to make mistakes when creating, updating, and deleting data. Imagine entering names into a spreadsheet containing employee information. If you were careless, you might accidentally enter someone's name in twice, or even write their date of birth instead. The spreadsheet doesn't prevent you from making these mistakes!

Redundant, missing, and incorrect information, are all possible due to traditional storage mediums' lack of data integrity enforcement. One of the best parts of databases are the rules it enforces to ensure that all data entry is clean and adheres to the rules set out by the users.

 Traditional storage mediums often lack strict prevention measures that

### Safe Concurrent Access
When multiple users are simultaneously accessing a database, the database ensures that each user's operations don't interfere with one another. On the other hand, spreadsheets give no guarantee of such safety. Imagine hundreds of users accidentally overwriting each others changes on a spreadsheet. The result could be potentially disastrous with cases of inconsistent or missing data. 

### Security
Databases make it much safer to deal with sensitive data. Users can be given different permissions that determine what kinds of database operations they're allowed to conduct. You don't necessarily want all users to have complete control over a database, and you definitely don't want to risk exposing private information to the public.




 provide many desirable features when dealing with large amounts of data.

Databases are more than just storage containers for data. If that's all they were capable of there would be little reason to choose a formal database over something like a spreadsheet. However, databases are designed to address important issues that come up when dealing with large amounts of data that more traditional storage mediums don't necessarily fix.

## What is a database?

A database is an **organized collection of data**. Although generally stored and accessed electronically from hardware, physical paper-based databases were definitely more common in the past, a good example being phonebooks.


Surprisingly, databases do not need to be stored and accessed from hardware to be classifised as one, although they generally are. Physical paper-based databases were definitely more common in the past (e.g. phonebooks), but did not provide the benefits.

"A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system."

At its most basic form, a database is a **structured collection of data**. Surprisingly, databases do not need to be stored on hardware to be classifised as one. Although virtually all databases today are computerized, physical paper-based databases were the norm back in the day. What really defines a database is the fact that the data is stored in a **structured** manner.

So what does structured data actually look like? Before that let's look at examples of unstructured data first.

 This means that the data should be organized in such a manner that will allow for efficient retrieval   

Unstructured data


 example, while an email may contain a large amount of data, it shouldn't be considered as a database since the data 

while email platforms can contain massive amounts of data, they should not be considered as databases since the data isn’t necessarily stored in a structured manner.

On the other hand, physical phone books can be viewed as databases because household and phone number data are recorded in an alphabetical list format.

Although databases are typically stored on hardware, they don't have to be. What makes a database a database is whether the data is structured or not.

Alternatively, an Excel spreadsheet can be identified as a database if the data is organized in a tabular format.

Phonebooks are a good example of a physical paper-based database

Modern databases support efficient creation, retrieval, modification, and deletion of data. 

  it actually doesn't matter whether the data is stored digitally or physically (e.g. phonebooks), as long the data is structured it can be considered a database. However, virtually all databases in use today are computerized, so naturally we'll be diving into that.

  Consider all the organizations you've registered with in your lifetime. They probably range from non-essential services like Facebook and Club Penguin, to much more important ones such as banking and medical. Regardless of what you signed up for, it's a guarantee that your personal information has been stored somewhere. And it doesn't just stop with registrations. Sports teams keep track of player statistics, shops record daily transactions, literally every organization out there is interested in saving some kind of data. The storage mediums they use to accomplish this are called **databases**. 


On the other hand, manipulating data on a spreadsheet can be tedious work. Imagine being a business owner who uses a spreadsheet to track inventory. What happens if you want to delete all records

### Easy and Efficient Operations
Databases make it very easy to create, find, sort, update, and delete data. All operations are optimized to be executed as quickly as possible.
