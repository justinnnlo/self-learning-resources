Self-Learning Resources Wiki\n✨ Brought to you from your friends at nwPlus!\nHi there, welcome to the Self-Learning Resources Wiki! Whether you're a student looking into getting into the field of Computer Science or already a seasoned developer, this guide hopes to provide some resources that will aid you in your journey into learning more about this vast field.\nWe've structured this guide such that there are chapters that cover topics that may help you in that leg of your journey. You can navigate them through the sidebar on the left.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nYou’ve never coded in your life\nNever written a line of code? No worries! This chapter will cover about what coding is, and a few guides into the basics of software development.\nBeginner\nYou know for-loops go brrrr but haven’t built anything tangible yet\nHave you just finished taking your first few CS courses and thought \"wow, that's pretty cool\"?

It doesn't necessarily mean that you're writing long lines of 0s and 1s, or even using a language that your computer can understand directly. So that brings us to our next question: \nWhat is a coding language?\nA little bit of context: the base layer of how computers work is binary code, which is the 0s and 1s thing that you've heard about. A coding language makes instructions readable and writeable for humans, but also understandable for computers. Sometimes these instructions correspond directly to 0s and 1s, but the code that you write usually isn't directly translatable for your computer, so a lot of the time, programs built into your computer will translate your code into binary. Quoting this article by Chris Castiglione, \"it’s like if you needed to speak to someone who in Mandarin, you only know English, and the only translator you could find spoke only Mandarin and French. You would need another translator to translate from English to French and then the first translator can translate French to Mandarin, hopefully without meaning getting lost in the process.\"\nWhat makes coding languages different? Why pick one over another?\nAt their core, coding languages do the same thing, as we mentioned above. However, there are many different ways to use computers, and the differences in languages reflects that. Certain languages are better for certain tasks because of the \"translations\" that were created for those languages.\nThere are a couple reasons:\n\nProgramming languages are tools, and we choose different tools for different jobs. For example, Javascript is great for building websites, but Python is better for analyzing statistics.\nPersonal preference. Sometimes some languages might resonate more with you than others!\nPopularity. Developers are more likely to learn languages that prospective employers use, and companies tend to use widely used languages to broaden their recruitment pool. \n\nWhere do I start?\nWe've linked a couple of suggestions for online courses below!

What exactly is this I D E you ask? IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. To put it simply, it's a programming text editor (intensified). You may be thinking, Microsoft Word? Google Docs? Pages? Like those types of word editors? Well… it’s possible to write code in those but trust us when we tell you, that would be brutal. Why struggle through that incomprehensible jumble of characters when there are solutions to write cleaner, faster and better code. Here are the key capabilities within an IDE that provide reason for you to install one ASAP!\n🔎 Why use it?\nYour \"environment\" is the setting that you create your projects in! It's all the things that come together to help your projects run smoothly. 🌴\n\nSyntax Highlighting and Autoformatting - One word: READABILITY, the most beneficial aspect of using a code editor! With built-in colour coding for different elements in a language and automatic indentation each line break, any programmer can easily read and refer back to any piece of code. Additionally, most code editors have built-in syntax checkers where errors will be underlined in a red squiggly line, halting your program from running until it's fixed!\n\nLet’s take a look, text editor 🤩 vs. word editor 🤢\n\nvia VSCode\n\nvia Google Docs\nNotice how easy it is to spot each component of the program in a coding environment whereas on a regular word editor you might easily glance past any comments amongst the code. In addition, the default nature of applications such as Google Docs may lead you to face compile errors due to case sensitivity.\n\nAutocompletion - Predicts and fills in code as you write, streamlining your coding workflow!\n\n\nIDE in use: IntelliJ IDEA\n\nDebugging - When you find yourself faced with command line errors, an unrunnable program or one that doesn't perform correctly, IDEs provide tools to help you examine and trace your code. The environment will notify you of pre compilation syntax errors or allow you to set breakpoints for trickier bugs. Learn more from our debugging guide! \n\nUnit Testing - Once you dive deeper into your software career you’ll learn about the importance of test driven design. Does your program pass all possible cases that it should? Your IDE can support testing frameworks for quality assurance purposes. Once again we'll be diving deeper into the world of testing later in our guide! \n\nVersion Control - Soon you’ll find many opportunities to collaborate with others on code, most IDEs can facilitate necessary commands (push, pull/update, commit, history, etc.) that allow you to keep up to date with your team without having to run another tool. Don’t worry if these terms are unfamiliar, we’ll cover them in our git guide! \n\n\nThe actual makeup of an IDE will vary from language to language and software to software. Overall, IDEs are an all-in-one editor where you can write, compile and debug code all in one place. With flexibility for add ons, the integration should be so seamless that you don’t need to leave your IDE to perform tasks. There are so many features to discover as you advance through your tech journey! ✨\n🚀 How do I set up an environment?\nOK, now out of the long list of IDEs you just googled for, which one do you download?? Here are some of our favourites, they’re versatile and flexible for all levels of experience!\nText editor suggestions:\n\nVisual Studio Code\nAtom\nSublime\n\nText editors are IDEs without the extra fluff. They may not be as “integrated” but are perfect development environment options as well. It’s a great place to start as they are easily accessible and quick to navigate. A quick download of your desired plugins and extension packs will leave the editor open to many functionalities. They’re not limited to a single language and still provide the beautiful colour coded formats and layouts. Your trusty text editor paired with the command line  will accompany you throughout your whole CS career.\nIDE suggestions:\n\nIntelliJ Idea for Java\nPyCharm for Python\nCLion for C/C++\n\n\nAs you can see, JetBrains offers a large list of IDEs for a variety of languages. Students can sign up to access the tools for free otherwise their products do come with a price tag so here are some free IDE alternatives:\n\nEclipse for Java\nNetbeans\n\nDon’t be afraid to test each out, play around and see which one you’re most comfortable with!

You might've already even heard of compile errors, stack overflow, or seg faults! The debugging process might be tedious and daunting, but this section will provide you with helpful tips and resources to tackle your bugs! 😤\n🔧 Debugging basics\n\nYour code should already be accessible in an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). For information on how to use an IDE and set it up, see . Although you could just debug with print statements, using an IDE will help you get a better look at what's happening in your code in real-time, such as viewing the call stack and watching variables.\n\nBreakpoints are like stop signs that you can intentionally place in your code. When you debug, the program will pause before the breakpoint line is executed. In whichever IDE you're working with, you should be able to place a breakpoint by clicking to the left of the line numbers.\n\n\n\nHere, a breakpoint is placed on line 27 (IntelliJ IDEA)\n\nWhen you hit debug, a debug tool window will appear and would look something like this. Usually, it'll include the call stack and local variables at that point in the code, as seen here:\n\n\nA default debug tool window in IntelliJ IDEA\n\nBy keeping track of all your variables as you go through your code, you'll probably clearly see where something went wrong. But wait! What are all those icons?\n\n\n  \n\n\nFrom left to right, these debugging controls are step over, step into, force step into, and step out - explained more below!\nCommon debugging controls\n\nWhen you step over a line, the debugger will simply move onto the next line. If the line contains a function/method call, it will be executed and returned without examining its implementation.\nWhen you step into a line that involves a call to some operation, the debugger will go to that implementation and examine what's happening inside. Typically, if you think a line/the action it calls could be causing a bug, you'd step into it to take a closer look!\nForce step into will, as it implies, force the debugger to step into a line if it was ignored by a regular step into command.\nStepping out will take you out of the current function/method and back to the caller.\nFor some examples, see JetBrains' Step through the program guide!\n\n🧠 Using Stack Overflow\nAt some point, you'll probably come across a scary red error that makes absolutely no sense to you. By copy-pasting the error message into a simple Google search, a StackOverflow will probably pop up! \n\nStack Overflow is kind of like Yahoo Answers, but for programmers! People post their problem, a snippet of their code, and what they've tried doing to fix it, and others will jump in to help with some big brain energy 🤓\nYou'll probably be able to find someone who has posted a question about the exact same error message as you! Don't skip straight to the answer with the most upvotes; instead, read through their problem to make sure you understand it before reading and understanding the solution. You shouldn't be hard-coding and slapping the solution straight into your code! How does the solution supplement your code, and how should you incorporate it?\nRemember that some posts may be outdated!\n\n🚫 Common Errors!\n\nSyntax errors:\nEvery programming language has different grammar rules! A syntax error will usually be underlined in a red squiggly line by your IDE and will stop your program from running. This might even lead to compilation errors, when the compiler is unable to turn your higher-level code into lower-level code.\nLogic errors: \nSometimes the hardest to recognize because, in your eyes, everything seems logical, yet your code yields unexpected behavior. Your output might be wrong, or the program might even crash. Some examples include a null reference, confusing '=' and '==' in a conditional statement, or declaring but not initializing a variable.\nCompilation errors:\nUsually a result of syntax or semantic errors. Detected by the compiler, your code will not run and an error message will be in the output. A simple example is forgetting to put a semicolon after a line in C - your corresponding error message will look something like: \"expected ' ; ' before ' } ' token\"\nRuntime errors:\nUnlike compilation errors, runtime errors are undetected by the compiler and cause your program to crash when the code is executed after successful compilation. Common runtime errors include memory leaks, division by zero, and giving the wrong input(s).\n\n✅ Writing Tests\nIn agile software development, test-driven design is a crucial component of writing code. By writing tests and checking their outputs, you can make sure your code performs as you intend it to. A collection of test cases is called a test suite, and should have these qualities:\n\nA test case should cover all possible combination of inputs and outputs for the method/function\n\nLet's take a look at this example...\n\n// a simple code snippet that compares two integers\n// we import Scanner so we can receive user keyboard input\nimport java.util.Scanner; \n\npublic class Test\n{\n  public static void main(String[] args)\n  {\n      // create Scanner to obtain input from command window\n      Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);\n      int x;\n      int y;\n\n      System.out.print( \"Input first integer x: \" ); // prompt user for first int\n      x = input.nextInt(); // read first number from user\n\n      System.out.print( \"Input second integer y: \" ); // prompt user for second int\n      y = input.nextInt(); // read second number from user\n\n      if (x > y) {\n          System.out.print(\"x is greater than y\");\n      } else {\n          System.out.print(\"x is less than y\");\n      }\n   }\n}\n\n\nThe two test cases that immediately come to mind are:\nwhen x is greater than y\nwhen y is greater than x\n\n\nIs that all? No, because we need to check what happens when x is equal to y! In the above code snippet, we can see if the first boolean ( x > y ) is false, then \"x is less than y\" will be printed. However, we forgot to account for the case where the two integers are both equal! In this case, we can modify the first condition to say if x is greater than or equal to y and change the print statement to match, or introduce a new branch that checks if ( x == y ) before the last else branch.\nOur third test case should be:\nwhen x is equal to y\n\n\nNow, we have accounted for all the possible inputs + outputs for this program! \n\n\nTesting a specific combination of inputs/outputs repetitively doesn't hurt, but is trivial and won't contribute to your overall code coverage\n\nBoundary checking: test edge cases within your range of values\nA test case should be named for the case it tests ;) \n\nDifferent IDE's have different unit testing frameworks, usually built-in. Be sure to familiarize yourself with their respective user guides/annotations. Some common examples are:\n\nIntelliJ IDEA - JUnit\nPyCharm - various, ex. PyCharm unittests, Pytest, etc.\nVisual Studio (C/C++) - various, ex. Microsoft Unit Testing Framework for C++, Google Test, etc.\n\n"},"2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html":{"url":"2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html","title":"How to Git/GitHub","keywords":"","body":"Welcome! Come learn about Git and Github.\nGit/Github can seem intimidating at first, but don't worry! There can be a steep learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it is an useful tool that 40 million users use. Use this guide as one of your resources and you'll be on your way on learning Git/Github! \nIt's a long read so grab some snacks and get comfy!\nWhat is Git and Github? What's the difference between them?\nGit\nBefore you understand what Git is, you'll need to understand what is a version code and control system. \nWhat’s a version control system?\nA version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As the project evolves, teams can run tests, fix bugs, and contribute new code with the confidence that any version can be recovered at any time. Developers can review project history to find out:\n\nWhich changes were made?\nWho made the changes?\nWhen were the changes made?\nWhy were changes needed?\n\nHere's how atlassian explains version code: \n\nGit is a software available for you to manage changes to your code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake\"\n\nThe same website explains \"What is Git\"\nHere are some main points from the article: \n\nWhy do we use Git?\n\nIt is the most widely used modern version control system in the world.\n\nThis is important because that means that if you collaborate with other developers, you'll be able to work within the same system.\n\n\n\n\nCompared to other alternatives, Git has the performance, security, flexibility that most teams and individuals need. It's the most broadly adopted tool of its kind, which makes that many individuals use it and third party software tools and services are already integrated with Git.\n\nMore questions? Check out the full article here!\nGitHub\nGitHub can be considered a code sharing and publishing service or a social networking site for programmers. \nCode sharing and publishing service \nTechcrunch describes GitHub as \"filing system for every draft of an document\".\nOne of GitHub's best functions is the ability to copy code from another user's account to another. You're able to take a project that you didn't make and modify it under your own account. \nTechcrunch describes GitHub as:\n\nThe flagship functionality of GitHub is “forking” – copying a repository (the main \"folder\" where the code is stored) from one user’s account to another. This enables you to take a project that you don’t have write access to and modify it under your own account. If you make changes you’d like to share, you can send a notification called a “pull request” to the original owner. That user can then, with a click of a button, merge the changes found in your repository  with the original repository.\nThese three features – fork, pull request and merge – are what make GitHub so powerful.\n\nBefore GitHub, you would have to manually download the project's source code, make changes on your own computer and then create a \"patch\" - which holds your changes and email the patch to the project's head programmer. Then, they would have to evaluate the patch and decide whether to add your changes to the original project. \nNetworking\nGitHub stores all your code where other people can see what you've written and your contributions to other projects. It's like a resume for your code. If your match is accepted, you're able to get credit on the original project, which shows up on your profile. \nMore questions?

It's a way to interface with your computer through text.\n\n  \n\n\nIn fact, you can do most — if not everything — through a command line that you can do through a pointing and clicking and using windows. Using the command line has a lot of its own benefits too. some things like installing things are as easy as a few keystrokes whereas you would normally have to go through navigating to a website, downloading an installer, and following all the steps.\n🤔 How do I use it?\nMac and Linux\nGetting Started\nMac → You can boot up a new command line by searching up 'Terminal' in Launchpad\nLinux → You can press CTRL+ALT+T to open a new Terminal\nBasic commands\n\nNavigating folders\ncd → is short for 'change directory'. If you were to compare it back to the graphical interface, its much like navigating and clicking through folders through your file explorer.\nWhen specifying a directory to change to, you can use either absolute or relative path names. The absolute or full path starts from the system root /, and relative path starts from your current directory.\nUsually when you start a new Terminal, you are in the home directory, commonly denoted as ~\nYou can navigate into folders by doing cd name-of-folder, and even nested folders by doing cd name-of-folder/nested-folder\nYou can go back one level of folders by doing cd .. and multiple levels by doing cd ../..\nStill confused? No worries! There are lots of resources that give you lots of information about cd. Here are a few:\n\nhttps://linuxize.com/post/linux-cd-command/\n\nls → is short for 'list'. This command tells you what files are in your current working directory. If you are in the home directory, the output will look something like this:\n→ ls\nApplications\nDesktop\nDownloads\nLibrary\nMusic\nFiles\nDocuments\nMovies\nPictures\n\n\nCopying, moving, and deleting files and folders\ncp → is short for 'copy'. This command lets you copy files and folders from one location to another. You can copy single files from A to B by doing cp A B. For example, if you want to copy a file from your Downloads into your home folder, it would look something like\n# copy a file from Downloads into the Home directory\ncp ~/Downloads/example.txt ~\n\nIf you need to copy an entire folder,  you can add the -r flag.\n# copy a folder inside Downloads to the current folder\n# you can reference current location using `.`\ncp -r ~/Downloads/example_folder .\n\nmv → is short for 'move'. The commands follow the same format as cp\nrm → is short for 'remove'. The commands follow the same format as mv and cp\n\nCreating files and folders\ntouch → creates new, empty files. For example, touch example.txt will create a new empty file with the name example.txt in the current directory.\nmkdir → is short for 'make directory' and makes a new folder. For example, mkdir folder-name will create an empty folder with the name folder-name in the current directory.\n\nViewing file contents\ncat → is short for 'concatenate' but really we just use it to print out file contents. Say you had a file called README.md and you wanted to quickly view what the contents of it were, you could do cat README.md and it would print out its contents into the terminal. If it's too long, you can do cat README.md | less so that it scrolls.\n\nEditing file contents\nnano → a simple text editor in the terminal. If you want to quickly edit the contents of a README, a Python script, or anything really, you can do nano file-name to edit it.

This can be retrieving user information, updating some data, etc. \nThe defacto way of communicating on the web is usually Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It's also why you see http:// or https:// in the URL of most websites. This protocol also defines a bunch of different types of requests that you can send! The two most common ones we will cover in this guide are the GET and POST methods. \nGET → retrieves specific data. (e.g. Load this webpage)\nPOST → sending data to a server (e.g. submitting a form)\nYou can find more about the others methods in some of the resources below.\n\nhttps://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http_methods.htm\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods\n\nNow, after you make a request, the server (if it's alive) should return you a response! The response should include a status code that tells you about the type of response you got. A common one that you might see is the 404, which tells you that the server couldn't find the thing you were asking for. Here are a few other pretty common categories:\n\n2xx → successful\n4xx → bad request\n5xx → server error\n\nIf you'd like some more detailed information on these status codes, this is a good resource: https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html\nHow/when to use them in a project\nGreat, so now that I know a little bit about how these APIs kind of work, how do I use them in my projects?\n"},"3-intermediate/apis-handson.html":{"url":"3-intermediate/apis-handson.html","title":"Getting hands-on","keywords":"","body":"Getting more hands-on with APIs\nCalling / Using an API\nWhen do I need to do this?\n\nYou need to request information to some external service (e.g. getting the current weather, fetching your facebook posts, etc.)\nYou need to communicate with a service someone else built (e.g. your teammate)\n\nThis is usually done through the aforementioned HTTP requests. Each language has a different way of making these requests. \nPython\nrequests library → https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/\nThis library makes it dead simple to make HTTP requests. If you have Python installed already, you can get this library by typing\npip install requests\n\nYou can then use requests in Python by importing it. \nimport requests\n\n# make a GET request to the GitHub API and store\n# the result in the variable r\nr = requests.get('https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests')\n\n# r.status_code will tell you the status of the request\nprint(r.status_code) \n# should print out '200'\n\n# you can then convert the actual body of the response into\n# a python readable form (a dictionary in this case)\nbody = r.json()\n\n# then you can get certain fields from the body\nprint(body[\"description\"]) \n# should print out 'A simple, yet elegant HTTP library.'\n\nJavaScript\nXMLHttpRequest → This is a built-in JavaScript object that lets you make HTTP requests in Vanilla JavaScript! Example usage is as follows,\n// create a function that tells JavaScript what to do\n// after receiving a response from the server\nfunction handleResponse () {\n    // create a 'response' variable that contains the response data\n    const response = this\n\n    // print out the status of the request\n    console.log(response.status)\n\n    // get the body of the request and parse into JSON \n    // (allows JavaScript to easily manipulate the data)\n    const body = JSON.parse(response.responseText)\n\n    // print out the description field again\n    console.log(body.description)\n}\n\n// create a new request object with the name 'r'\nconst r = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n// add an event listener so that we run 'handleResponse()' after the\n// request 'r' loads\nr.addEventListener(\"load\", handleResponse);\n\n// make the actual request to the resource using GET\nr.open(\"GET\", \"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests\");\nr.send();\n\nYou can learn more about XMLHttpRequest here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest\nAxios → Axios is a Promise-based alternative to XMLHttpRequest that works in Node.js too :)) I'm not going to go into too much detail but it is definitely a more clean and easier way to do HTTP requests in JavaScript if you don't mind using external libraries. You can read more here: https://github.com/axios/axios\nYou can read a more detailed guide here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introducti\nBuilding your own API\nWhen do I need to do this? → \n\nYou need to serve up some information (e.g. get user details from a database)\nYou need to cobble together a bunch of other APIs (e.g. get data from current weather and feed it into Google Search API)\n\nThe implementation vastly differs per language, but the main concept is the same: you create a HTTP server that listens for and responds to requests from the internet. Both Python and JavaScript have frameworks that make it simple to do just that. Going into the implementation of each is a little outside the scope of this guide, so instead we'll link a few good guides and tutorials that we've found to get you started.\nPython — Flask framework\nSite → https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/\nResources\nInstallation → https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/\nA 'hello world' → https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/layout/\nA full Flask API by example → https://realpython.com/flask-by-example-part-1-project-setup/\nLHD Flask Example → https://github.com/jackyzha0/lhd-build-python-webapp\n\nJavaScript — Express framework\nSite → https://expressjs.com/\nResources\nInstallation → https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html\nA 'hello world' → https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html\nA complete guide → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs\nMore advanced topics\nAPI Keys\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nAn application programming interface key (API key) is a unique identifier used to authenticate a user, developer, or calling program to an API\n\nWhen you start looking at third-party APIs, many of them will mention API Keys. Basically, these are long strings that tell the API who you are so they know you have permission to access it. You can find more information on how to include the API key here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface_key\nHosting your API\nWhat do you do after you've made an API? You may have noticed that your API only lives on your local machine and that nobody else can use it! So, how do we expose our API to the internet? The easiest way to do this is to host our API on a third-party provider. Just to name a few, Heroku, Google Cloud (GCP), and Amazon Web Services (AWS) are all widely used. Below, we've provided some resources and starter guides for each of these to help you get your API onto the internet!\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/deployment\n"},"3-intermediate/software-development-lifecycle.html":{"url":"3-intermediate/software-development-lifecycle.html","title":"Software Development Lifecycle","keywords":"","body":"The Software Development Life Cycle\nIs there a general timeline people in the industry follow when developing their software project? Yes! The software development life cycle (SDLC) is commonly used as a guideline for what tasks need to be accomplished before the completion of a software project. There are many variations of the SDLC which depend on project complexity. There are several stages to this life cycle as shown below. This section will provide a brief summary of why people use SDLC, different types of SDLC, and what happens during each respective stage of development.\n\n\nImage from: https://datarob.com/essentials-software-development-life-cycle/\n\nAdvantages of SDLC\nThis is why you should consider using a software developement cycle!\n\noverarching control over software development process\nimproves resource management and cost-effectiveness\nprovides clear action plan → increases transparency\nimproves cooperation between participants\n\nStages of SDLC\nThere are 6 important stages to the SDLC:\n\nPlanning & Requirement Analysis\nproduct owner or senior members of the team conducts preliminary analysis to discover aims and issues of the client\nplanning for quality assurance requirements and identification of risks\nteam proposes set of solutions with a budget and risks for each solution\n\n\nDefining Requirements\nclearly define and document a specification of requirements based on solution the client has chosen (Software Requirement Specification aka SRS)\nteam analyses documents related to project and evaluates the client's existing ecosystem\n\n\nDesigning Product Architecture\ncreate several product architecture diagrams based on SRS for client to choose from\nchosen architecture finalized in Design Document Specification (DDS) and evaluated in terms of risks, operation reliability, universality, and cost-effectiveness\nDDS reviewed by all stakeholders\n\n\nImplementation/Development\nprogramming code is developed as per DDS by developers\ndevelopment takes majority of the life cycle\nproduct may change during this stage\n\n\nTesting & Integration\nquality assurance engineers (QA) test product for bugs\ntesting should be throughout all stages of the life cycle\nspecifically in this stage, product defects are reports, tracked, fixed, and retested until meeting standards in SRS\n\n\nDeployment & Maintenance\nproduct is released to appropriate market\nproduct may first be released in limited segment and tested in real business environment\nbased on feedback, may e released as is or with suggested enhancements in targeting market segment\nmaintenance is done for existing customer base\n\n\n\nTypes of SDLC\nThere are also 6 types of SDLC that the industry uses: Agile, Iterative, Spiral, Waterfall, V-Shaped, and Big Bang. You might be wondering, \"what even????\". Below provides a brief overview of each type of SDLC. Agile is currently one of the most popular types of SDLC used in the tech industry so make sure to read up on at least that part for a starter! If you ever try interviewing for a technical position at a software company, knowing how the Agile model, specifically scrum, works are lots of brownie points!\n✨ Agile Model\nWhat is Agile?\n\nmethodology for modeling and documenting software systems\nmany current firms have implemented the agile model\nallows for fast adjustments\nuses Scrum and XP approaches\n\nWhat is scrum?\n\ngoal of delivering new software capability every 2-4 weeks\nemphasis in information transparency within the team\nfrequent inspections to detect variances and make adjustments early\n\nThere are many different components that make up Agile Scrum Development:\nScrum Team\n\nProduct Owner\nproject's key stakeholder (usually internal or external customer)\nonly one product owner\nconveys mission and vision of product\naccountable for managing product backlog and accepting completed increments of work\n\n\nScrumMaster\nFacilitator\nensures team adheres to Scrum theory, practice and rules\nremoves impediments, facilitates meetings, and helps Product Owner with backlog\n\n\nDevelopment Team\nself-organizing and cross-functional group\nanyone who participates in the creation of the delivered increment\nno titles in the development team (no hierarchy)\n\n\n\nScrum Events\nA lot of different events make up the entire scrum process. Below are the components that make up most scrums in the industry.\n\nSprint\ntime-boxed period where specific work is complemented and made ready for review (usually 2-4 weeks long)\n\n\nSprint Planning Sprint\ntime-boxed planning team meetings to determine which product backlog items will be delivered and how\n\n\nDaily Stand-Up\nshort meeting with all team members to quickly cover progress since last stand up, planned work for next stand-up, and any impediments blocking progress\n\n\nSprint Review\nteam presents/demos work completed during sprint while Product Owner checks work against pre-defined criteria to accept or reject; stakeholders provide feedback\n\n\nRetrospective aka Retro\nfinal team meeting in sprint to reflect on what went well, what didn't, how team can improve\n\n\n\nScrum Artifacts\n\nProduct Backlog\ndocument that outlines every requirement for system, project or product\nto-do list with work items ordered in terms of business value by Product Owner\n\n\nSprint Backlog\nspecific list of items from product backlog to be completed during a sprint\n\n\nIncrement\nsum of all product backlog items that have been completed since last software release\nteam must ensure everything in increment is ready to be released\n\n\n\nWhat is XP (extreme programming)?\nPractices\n\nsit together for face-to-face team meetings\npair programming - all production software developed by two people sitting at the same machine\nstories - describe what the product should do in terms that are meaningful to customers and users\nweekly cycle/iteration\nteam meets on first day of week to reflect on progress\ncustomer picks stories they want delivered for that week\nteam determines how to approach those stories\n\n\nquarterly cycle/release\ncustomer lays out overall plan for team in terms of features desired within a particular quarter\nplan high level deliverables for stories\n\n\nslack - add low priority tasks or stories to weekly and quarterly cycles that can be dropped if team caught up with more important tasks\nten-minute build - automatic build of entire system and run all tests in ten minutes (encourages automation of build process)\ncontinuous integration - code changes immediately tested when added to larger code base\ntest-first programming - write failing automated test → run failing test → develop code to make test pass → run test → repeat\nincremental design - understand breadth-wise perspective of system design before diving into details of specific features of design\n\nRoles\n\ncustomer makes business decisions (ie. what the system does, budget for project)\ndeveloper realizes specifications of the customer\ntracker (optional) keeps track of relevant metrics to track progress and identify areas of improvement for the team\n\nLife Cycle\n\ncustomers define desired results of project (stories)\nteam estimates size of each story\nteam may introduce research for stories in which they don't understand all the technical considerations\nentire team gets together to create release plan\nteam performs weekly cycles\nteam and customer get together at beginning of week to decide which stories should be realized\nteam and customer review progress to date at end of week\n\n\n\nIterative Model\n\nmany SDLC segmented into smaller cycles\nstarts cycle with lots of trialling\nuses Rational Unified Process which divides development process into five distinct phases:\nbusiness modeling\nanalysis and design\nimplementation\ntesting\ndeployment\n\n\nallows for micromanagement\none of the most reliable approaches to development process\n\nSpiral Model\n\nemphasizes smaller cycles within larger SDLC cycles\ndevelopers spend more time on tasks rather by putting together all key steps of development process\nwidely used for gradual improvements of a product\n\nWaterfall Model\n\nall steps finalized before starting development\nreceive approval on each stage before team moves on to next stage\neffective in risk mitigation\nmay use Business Requirements Specification (documentation of customer's needs and expectations for the project) to evaluate each stage\nless popular of a model in current industry\n\nV-Shaped Model\n\nextension to waterfall model\ncompletion of one stage before moving on to the next\nrequires constant trialing during life cycle\n\nBig Bang Model\n\nno guidelines!\nmodel was created to help navigate projects where there is little to no initial information for what the project should look like\nteam figures out project as they go\nmore fitting for small development teams, small or short-term projects\n\n"},"recs/online-courses.html":{"url":"recs/online-courses.html","title":"Online Courses","keywords":"","body":"Online courses\n→ All resources are (mostly) free unless stated otherwise.\nCodecademy: Start learning how to code... by coding!
