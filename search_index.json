Self-Learning Resources Wiki\n✨ Brought to you from your friends at nwPlus!\nHi there, welcome to the Self-Learning Resources Wiki! Whether you're a student looking into getting into the field of Computer Science or already a seasoned developer, this guide hopes to provide some resources that will aid you in your journey into learning more about this vast field.\nWe've structured this guide such that there are chapters that cover topics that may help you in that leg of your journey. You can navigate them through the sidebar on the left.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nYou’ve never coded in your life\nNever written a line of code? No worries! This chapter will cover about what coding is, and a few guides into the basics of software development.\nBeginner\nYou know for-loops go brrrr but haven’t built anything tangible yet\nHave you just finished taking your first few CS courses and thought \"wow, that's pretty cool\"? This chapter is for you. It will cover some software development essentials that aren't usually covered in class like Git, the command line, and more!\nIntermediate\nYou’ve built and deployed some stuff but want to go deeper\nBuilt a few simple projects and maybe even gone to a hackathon or two? This chapter will cover some more advanced topics like APIs, coding interviews, and more.\n\n\nMade with 💖 by nwPlus.\n"},"1-getting-started/what-is-coding.html":{"url":"1-getting-started/what-is-coding.html","title":"What is coding?","keywords":"","body":"What is coding?\nAs said by makeuseof.com, \"coding is the process of using a programming language to get a computer to behave how you want it to\". It doesn't necessarily mean that you're writing long lines of 0s and 1s, or even using a language that your computer can understand directly. So that brings us to our next question: \nWhat is a coding language?\nA little bit of context: the base layer of how computers work is binary code, which is the 0s and 1s thing that you've heard about. A coding language makes instructions readable and writeable for humans, but also understandable for computers. Sometimes these instructions correspond directly to 0s and 1s, but the code that you write usually isn't directly translatable for your computer, so a lot of the time, programs built into your computer will translate your code into binary. Quoting this article by Chris Castiglione, \"it’s like if you needed to speak to someone who in Mandarin, you only know English, and the only translator you could find spoke only Mandarin and French. You would need another translator to translate from English to French and then the first translator can translate French to Mandarin, hopefully without meaning getting lost in the process.\"\nWhat makes coding languages different? Why pick one over another?\nAt their core, coding languages do the same thing, as we mentioned above. However, there are many different ways to use computers, and the differences in languages reflects that. Certain languages are better for certain tasks because of the \"translations\" that were created for those languages.\nThere are a couple reasons:\n\nProgramming languages are tools, and we choose different tools for different jobs. For example, Javascript is great for building websites, but Python is better for analyzing statistics.\nPersonal preference. Sometimes some languages might resonate more with you than others!\nPopularity. Developers are more likely to learn languages that prospective employers use, and companies tend to use widely used languages to broaden their recruitment pool. \n\nWhere do I start?\nWe've linked a couple of suggestions for online courses below! Happy coding! :sparkles:\n\nHarvard CS50: Introduction to Computer Science\nUniversity of Michigan's Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)\n\n"},"1-getting-started/ides-and-text-editors.html":{"url":"1-getting-started/ides-and-text-editors.html","title":"A Newcomers Guide to IDEs (and text editors)","keywords":"","body":"👀 What is an IDE?\nBefore we begin coding it’s important to get you set up with an IDE. What exactly is this I D E you ask? IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. To put it simply, it's a programming text editor (intensified). You may be thinking, Microsoft Word? Google Docs? Pages? Like those types of word editors? Well… it’s possible to write code in those but trust us when we tell you, that would be brutal. Why struggle through that incomprehensible jumble of characters when there are solutions to write cleaner, faster and better code. Here are the key capabilities within an IDE that provide reason for you to install one ASAP!\n🔎 Why use it?\nYour \"environment\" is the setting that you create your projects in! It's all the things that come together to help your projects run smoothly. 🌴\n\nSyntax Highlighting and Autoformatting - One word: READABILITY, the most beneficial aspect of using a code editor! With built-in colour coding for different elements in a language and automatic indentation each line break, any programmer can easily read and refer back to any piece of code. Additionally, most code editors have built-in syntax checkers where errors will be underlined in a red squiggly line, halting your program from running until it's fixed!\n\nLet’s take a look, text editor 🤩 vs. word editor 🤢\n\nvia VSCode\n\nvia Google Docs\nNotice how easy it is to spot each component of the program in a coding environment whereas on a regular word editor you might easily glance past any comments amongst the code. In addition, the default nature of applications such as Google Docs may lead you to face compile errors due to case sensitivity.\n\nAutocompletion - Predicts and fills in code as you write, streamlining your coding workflow!\n\n\nIDE in use: IntelliJ IDEA\n\nDebugging - When you find yourself faced with command line errors, an unrunnable program or one that doesn't perform correctly, IDEs provide tools to help you examine and trace your code. The environment will notify you of pre compilation syntax errors or allow you to set breakpoints for trickier bugs. Learn more from our debugging guide! \n\nUnit Testing - Once you dive deeper into your software career you’ll learn about the importance of test driven design. Does your program pass all possible cases that it should? Your IDE can support testing frameworks for quality assurance purposes. Once again we'll be diving deeper into the world of testing later in our guide! \n\nVersion Control - Soon you’ll find many opportunities to collaborate with others on code, most IDEs can facilitate necessary commands (push, pull/update, commit, history, etc.) that allow you to keep up to date with your team without having to run another tool. Don’t worry if these terms are unfamiliar, we’ll cover them in our git guide! \n\n\nThe actual makeup of an IDE will vary from language to language and software to software. Overall, IDEs are an all-in-one editor where you can write, compile and debug code all in one place. With flexibility for add ons, the integration should be so seamless that you don’t need to leave your IDE to perform tasks. There are so many features to discover as you advance through your tech journey! ✨\n🚀 How do I set up an environment?\nOK, now out of the long list of IDEs you just googled for, which one do you download?? Here are some of our favourites, they’re versatile and flexible for all levels of experience!\nText editor suggestions:\n\nVisual Studio Code\nAtom\nSublime\n\nText editors are IDEs without the extra fluff. They may not be as “integrated” but are perfect development environment options as well. It’s a great place to start as they are easily accessible and quick to navigate. A quick download of your desired plugins and extension packs will leave the editor open to many functionalities. They’re not limited to a single language and still provide the beautiful colour coded formats and layouts. Your trusty text editor paired with the command line  will accompany you throughout your whole CS career.\nIDE suggestions:\n\nIntelliJ Idea for Java\nPyCharm for Python\nCLion for C/C++\n\n\nAs you can see, JetBrains offers a large list of IDEs for a variety of languages. Students can sign up to access the tools for free otherwise their products do come with a price tag so here are some free IDE alternatives:\n\nEclipse for Java\nNetbeans\n\nDon’t be afraid to test each out, play around and see which one you’re most comfortable with!

You might've already even heard of compile errors, stack overflow, or seg faults! The debugging process might be tedious and daunting, but this section will provide you with helpful tips and resources to tackle your bugs! 😤\n🔧 Debugging basics\n\nYour code should already be accessible in an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). For information on how to use an IDE and set it up, see . Although you could just debug with print statements, using an IDE will help you get a better look at what's happening in your code in real-time, such as viewing the call stack and watching variables.\n\nBreakpoints are like stop signs that you can intentionally place in your code. When you debug, the program will pause before the breakpoint line is executed. In whichever IDE you're working with, you should be able to place a breakpoint by clicking to the left of the line numbers.\n\n\n\nHere, a breakpoint is placed on line 27 (IntelliJ IDEA)\n\nWhen you hit debug, a debug tool window will appear and would look something like this. Usually, it'll include the call stack and local variables at that point in the code, as seen here:\n\n\nA default debug tool window in IntelliJ IDEA\n\nBy keeping track of all your variables as you go through your code, you'll probably clearly see where something went wrong. But wait! What are all those icons?\n\n\n  \n\n\nFrom left to right, these debugging controls are step over, step into, force step into, and step out - explained more below!\nCommon debugging controls\n\nWhen you step over a line, the debugger will simply move onto the next line. If the line contains a function/method call, it will be executed and returned without examining its implementation.\nWhen you step into a line that involves a call to some operation, the debugger will go to that implementation and examine what's happening inside. Typically, if you think a line/the action it calls could be causing a bug, you'd step into it to take a closer look!\nForce step into will, as it implies, force the debugger to step into a line if it was ignored by a regular step into command.\nStepping out will take you out of the current function/method and back to the caller.\nFor some examples, see JetBrains' Step through the program guide!\n\n🧠 Using Stack Overflow\nAt some point, you'll probably come across a scary red error that makes absolutely no sense to you. By copy-pasting the error message into a simple Google search, a StackOverflow will probably pop up! \n\nStack Overflow is kind of like Yahoo Answers, but for programmers! People post their problem, a snippet of their code, and what they've tried doing to fix it, and others will jump in to help with some big brain energy 🤓\nYou'll probably be able to find someone who has posted a question about the exact same error message as you! Don't skip straight to the answer with the most upvotes; instead, read through their problem to make sure you understand it before reading and understanding the solution. You shouldn't be hard-coding and slapping the solution straight into your code! How does the solution supplement your code, and how should you incorporate it?\nRemember that some posts may be outdated!\n\n🚫 Common Errors!\n\nSyntax errors:\nEvery programming language has different grammar rules! A syntax error will usually be underlined in a red squiggly line by your IDE and will stop your program from running. This might even lead to compilation errors, when the compiler is unable to turn your higher-level code into lower-level code.\nLogic errors: \nSometimes the hardest to recognize because, in your eyes, everything seems logical, yet your code yields unexpected behavior. Your output might be wrong, or the program might even crash. Some examples include a null reference, confusing '=' and '==' in a conditional statement, or declaring but not initializing a variable.\nCompilation errors:\nUsually a result of syntax or semantic errors. Detected by the compiler, your code will not run and an error message will be in the output. A simple example is forgetting to put a semicolon after a line in C - your corresponding error message will look something like: \"expected ' ; ' before ' } ' token\"\nRuntime errors:\nUnlike compilation errors, runtime errors are undetected by the compiler and cause your program to crash when the code is executed after successful compilation. Common runtime errors include memory leaks, division by zero, and giving the wrong input(s).\n\n✅ Writing Tests\nIn agile software development, test-driven design is a crucial component of writing code. By writing tests and checking their outputs, you can make sure your code performs as you intend it to. A collection of test cases is called a test suite, and should have these qualities:\n\nA test case should cover all possible combination of inputs and outputs for the method/function\n\nLet's take a look at this example...\n\n// a simple code snippet that compares two integers\n// we import Scanner so we can receive user keyboard input\nimport java.util.Scanner; \n\npublic class Test\n{\n  public static void main(String[] args)\n  {\n      // create Scanner to obtain input from command window\n      Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);\n      int x;\n      int y;\n\n      System.out.print( \"Input first integer x: \" ); // prompt user for first int\n      x = input.nextInt(); // read first number from user\n\n      System.out.print( \"Input second integer y: \" ); // prompt user for second int\n      y = input.nextInt(); // read second number from user\n\n      if (x > y) {\n          System.out.print(\"x is greater than y\");\n      } else {\n          System.out.print(\"x is less than y\");\n      }\n   }\n}\n\n\nThe two test cases that immediately come to mind are:\nwhen x is greater than y\nwhen y is greater than x\n\n\nIs that all? No, because we need to check what happens when x is equal to y! In the above code snippet, we can see if the first boolean ( x > y ) is false, then \"x is less than y\" will be printed. However, we forgot to account for the case where the two integers are both equal! In this case, we can modify the first condition to say if x is greater than or equal to y and change the print statement to match, or introduce a new branch that checks if ( x == y ) before the last else branch.\nOur third test case should be:\nwhen x is equal to y\n\n\nNow, we have accounted for all the possible inputs + outputs for this program! \n\n\nTesting a specific combination of inputs/outputs repetitively doesn't hurt, but is trivial and won't contribute to your overall code coverage\n\nBoundary checking: test edge cases within your range of values\nA test case should be named for the case it tests ;) \n\nDifferent IDE's have different unit testing frameworks, usually built-in. Be sure to familiarize yourself with their respective user guides/annotations. Some common examples are:\n\nIntelliJ IDEA - JUnit\nPyCharm - various, ex. PyCharm unittests, Pytest, etc.\nVisual Studio (C/C++) - various, ex. Microsoft Unit Testing Framework for C++, Google Test, etc.\n\n"},"2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html":{"url":"2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html","title":"How to Git/GitHub","keywords":"","body":"Welcome! Come learn about Git and Github.\nGit/Github can seem intimidating at first, but don't worry! There can be a steep learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it is an useful tool that 40 million users use. Use this guide as one of your resources and you'll be on your way on learning Git/Github! \nIt's a long read so grab some snacks and get comfy!\nWhat is Git and Github? What's the difference between them?\nGit\nBefore you understand what Git is, you'll need to understand what is a version code and control system. \nWhat’s a version control system?\nA version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As the project evolves, teams can run tests, fix bugs, and contribute new code with the confidence that any version can be recovered at any time. Developers can review project history to find out:\n\nWhich changes were made?\nWho made the changes?\nWhen were the changes made?\nWhy were changes needed?\n\nHere's how atlassian explains version code: \n\nGit is a software available for you to manage changes to your code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake\"\n\nThe same website explains \"What is Git\"\nHere are some main points from the article: \n\nWhy do we use Git?\n\nIt is the most widely used modern version control system in the world.\n\nThis is important because that means that if you collaborate with other developers, you'll be able to work within the same system.\n\n\n\n\nCompared to other alternatives, Git has the performance, security, flexibility that most teams and individuals need. It's the most broadly adopted tool of its kind, which makes that many individuals use it and third party software tools and services are already integrated with Git.\n\nMore questions? Check out the full article here!\nGitHub\nGitHub can be considered a code sharing and publishing service or a social networking site for programmers. \nCode sharing and publishing service \nTechcrunch describes GitHub as \"filing system for every draft of an document\".\nOne of GitHub's best functions is the ability to copy code from another user's account to another. You're able to take a project that you didn't make and modify it under your own account. \nTechcrunch describes GitHub as:\n\nThe flagship functionality of GitHub is “forking” – copying a repository (the main \"folder\" where the code is stored) from one user’s account to another. This enables you to take a project that you don’t have write access to and modify it under your own account. If you make changes you’d like to share, you can send a notification called a “pull request” to the original owner. That user can then, with a click of a button, merge the changes found in your repository  with the original repository.\nThese three features – fork, pull request and merge – are what make GitHub so powerful.\n\nBefore GitHub, you would have to manually download the project's source code, make changes on your own computer and then create a \"patch\" - which holds your changes and email the patch to the project's head programmer. Then, they would have to evaluate the patch and decide whether to add your changes to the original project. \nNetworking\nGitHub stores all your code where other people can see what you've written and your contributions to other projects. It's like a resume for your code. If your match is accepted, you're able to get credit on the original project, which shows up on your profile. \nMore questions?

Most of the applications you use on a day-to-day basis, likewise, are interacted with through a GUI. \nHowever, there's a much lesser known way of navigating your device: a command line interface or \"CLI\" for short. With a CLI, instead of using your mouse, you're able to type in textual commands, sometimes called \"prompts\", to do just about anything. \n\n  \n  In any movie, the \"hacker\" character is almost always using a CLI.\n\n\nOther than looking like a hacker (which is cool enough in its own right), using the command line comes with a ton of practical benefits. One of the biggest benefits is speed. Installing new software with a command line is as easy as a few keystrokes, whereas you would normally have to go through the process of going to a website, downloading an installer, and clicking through the various menus in the installer.\nThe command line is especially important for developers, as there are a number of tools that we can only use through the command line. For example, you can use git entirely through the command line, though there also are many git GUI options. Many applications, however, do not have a GUI, so knowledge of the command line is key.\n💻 Terminal terminology\nThough it's not necessary to know to be able to use the command line, we've created a guide on the various terms that crop up when trying to do more advanced command line things. If you're looking to get started ASAP, feel free to skip this section for now.\n🤔 How do I use it?\nIf you're looking for a more hands-on introduction, we've created two separate sections for setting up your terminal and learning some basic commands, each tailored to a specific operating system. If you're using Windows, feel free to check out of the Windows guide, and likewise, there's a separate guide for Mac/Linux.\nMore resources\nIf you want to learn more about the command line, here are a list of great resources to help you dive deeper.\n\nThe Missing Semester of Your CS Education, Command-line Environments\n\n"},"2-beginner/terminal-terminology.html":{"url":"2-beginner/terminal-terminology.html","title":"Terminal terminology (optional)","keywords":"","body":"Terminal Terminology\nSo far, we've only ever referred to the any text-command-thing as a \"command line interface\" or CLI. However, there's a bit more nuance to the command line. Note that this section is optional, but will really aid your understanding of how everything is working under the hood.\nCommand line\nA command line is any interface where a user types in commands as text, and hits \"Enter\" to execute that command. Simple as that!\nShell\nA shell is a program which does the actual processing of the commands you give it (through a terminal). It is the interpreter which powers your command line. There are many different kinds of shells. Two of the most popular are Bash (on Mac/Linux) and Command Prompt (on Windows).\nTerminal\nA terminal is a wrapper program which allows you to give commands to a shell. The word terminal used to actually refer to physical devices. Instead of having a \"computer\" as we know it today where you could choose to interact with a GUI, a terminal provided you with a command line and nothing more. Nowadays, the concept of a \"terminal\" has been abstracted into software, but the idea is functionally the same. It provides a way for you to give commands to a shell, and handles instructions given to it from the shell. \nTwo popular terminal programs are Terminal (on a Mac) and Windows Terminal (available in the Microsoft Store). Terminals, generally, support all kinds of shells. In Windows Terminal, for example, you can have Bash, CMD, PowerShell, Ubuntu, and more all in separate tabs.\nConsole\nThe word console is now what we would call a \"physical terminal,\" though it is effectively interchangeable with terminal. \nRead more\nWhat's the difference between a console, a terminal, and a shell? by Scott Hanselman\nWhat is the exact difference between a 'terminal', a 'shell', a 'tty' and a 'console'? on the Unix Stack Exchange\nWhat is the difference between Terminal, Console, Shell, and Command Line? on the Ubuntu Stack Exchange\n"},"2-beginner/command-line-mac-linux.html":{"url":"2-beginner/command-line-mac-linux.html","title":"Getting started on Mac or Linux","keywords":"","body":"🍎🐧 Mac and Linux\nGetting Started\nMac → You can boot up a new command line by searching up 'Terminal' in Launchpad\nLinux → You can press CTRL+ALT+T to open a new Terminal\nBasic commands\n\nNavigating folders\ncd → is short for 'change directory'. If you were to compare it back to the graphical interface, its much like navigating and clicking through folders through your file explorer.\nWhen specifying a directory to change to, you can use either absolute or relative path names. The absolute or full path starts from the system root /, and relative path starts from your current directory.\nUsually when you start a new Terminal, you are in the home directory, commonly denoted as ~\nYou can navigate into folders by doing cd name-of-folder, and even nested folders by doing cd name-of-folder/nested-folder\nYou can go back one level of folders by doing cd .. and multiple levels by doing cd ../..\nStill confused? No worries! There are lots of resources that give you lots of information about cd. Here are a few:\n\nhttps://linuxize.com/post/linux-cd-command/\n\nls → is short for 'list'. This command tells you what files are in your current working directory. If you are in the home directory, the output will look something like this:\n→ ls\nApplications\nDesktop\nDownloads\nLibrary\nMusic\nFiles\nDocuments\nMovies\nPictures\n\n\nCopying, moving, and deleting files and folders\ncp → is short for 'copy'. This command lets you copy files and folders from one location to another. You can copy single files from A to B by doing cp A B. For example, if you want to copy a file from your Downloads into your home folder, it would look something like\n# copy a file from Downloads into the Home directory\ncp ~/Downloads/example.txt ~\n\nIf you need to copy an entire folder,  you can add the -r flag.\n# copy a folder inside Downloads to the current folder\n# you can reference current location using `.`\ncp -r ~/Downloads/example_folder .\n\nmv → is short for 'move'. The commands follow the same format as cp\nrm → is short for 'remove'. The commands follow the same format as mv and cp\n\nCreating files and folders\ntouch → creates new, empty files. For example, touch example.txt will create a new empty file with the name example.txt in the current directory.\nmkdir → is short for 'make directory' and makes a new folder. For example, mkdir folder-name will create an empty folder with the name folder-name in the current directory.\n\nViewing file contents\ncat → is short for 'concatenate' but really we just use it to print out file contents. Say you had a file called README.md and you wanted to quickly view what the contents of it were, you could do cat README.md and it would print out its contents into the terminal. If it's too long, you can do cat README.md | less so that it scrolls.\n\nEditing file contents\nnano → a simple text editor in the terminal. If you want to quickly edit the contents of a README, a Python script, or anything really, you can do nano file-name to edit it.

Package managers may be for you!\n\napt (Linux)\napt is a package manager that comes pre-installed with Linux. It makes it super easy to install packages and other stuff. You can install a new package by doing sudo apt install . For example, if you wanted to install pip, a Python package manager for Python 3, you can just do sudo apt install python3-pip. To uninstall, you can just do sudo apt purge python3-pip.\nYou can find more info here: https://itsfoss.com/apt-command-guide/\n\nbrew (Mac)\nHomebrew is the \"missing package manager for macOS\". Basically, it lets you manage, install, and remove software super easily through the command line. To install it, paste this into your terminal# install homebrew\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\"\n\nThen, installing pa is as easy as brew install python. To uninstall, it's as easy as brew uninstall python.\n\nYou can read more here: https://brew.sh/\n\n\n"},"2-beginner/command-line-windows.html":{"url":"2-beginner/command-line-windows.html","title":"Getting started on Windows","keywords":"","body":"🟦 Windows\nThere's a bit more context we need to know to get started with the command line on a Windows machine, but a PC is still great for software development. While on a Mac or Linux we have access to a kind of shell called \"bash\" from the get go, on Windows we instead have the Command Prompt (CMD) and PowerShell. While you can install a version of bash on your machine, here I'll assume you do not have access to bash. If you do, you're welcome to follow the steps from the section on Mac/Linux setup.\nGetting started\nFor just about everything, you'll want to use PowerShell. It's a bit more advanced than CMD, works really well for the tasks most common for a developer, and is a bit fancier under the hood, allowing you to pass \"richer\" information between commands.\nTo open PowerShell, simply head to the Windows search bar and type in PowerShell. You can also use it as an integrated terminal within your favorite IDE, such as VS Code.\nBasic commands\n\nNavigating folders\ncd → See the Mac/Linux description for more info.\nls → See the Mac/Linux description description for more info.\n\n\nCopying, moving, and deleting files and folders\ncp → See the Mac/Linux description description for more info.\nmv → See the Mac/Linux description description for more info.\nrm → See the Mac/Linux description description for more info.\n\n\nCreating files and folders\nni → To create a new file, run ni , such as, ni example.txt. \nmd → To create a new directory, run md , such as, md example. \n\n\nViewing file contents\ncat → See the Mac/Linux description description for more info.\n\n\nEditing file contents\nnotepad → To edit a text file or see some content in plaintext, run notepad , such as notepad example.txt.\n\n\n\nNote that for a lot of these commands, even though they look the same as their Mac/Linux equivalent, they're actually just aliases for other PowerShell commands. For example, rm in PowerShell actually runs Remove-Item. You can see this for yourself by typing Get-Alias rm into PowerShell.\nWhat does this mean for you? Well, sometimes, if you copy and paste a rm ... from the internet, it might not work, since Remove-Item behaves a little differently than bash rm. However, there is a way to use bash directly on a Windows computer to avoid this headache. More on that at the end of the \"Package Managers\" section!\nAn aside\nWant to look like a real hacker on Windows?\n\nOpen Windows search and type in \"run\", and open Run, or alternatively, hit Windows + R.\nType \"cmd\" into run and hit enter.\nRun color a.\nRun tree.\n(Hit CTRL + C to stop the tree.)\n\nIf this doesn't impress your non-techie friends, what will!\nPackage Managers\nAs is mentioned in the Mac and Linux section, package managers are great for being able to manage all of the software you need as a developer: editors, tools, applications, and more. Microsoft is actively developing a package manager available in the Microsoft Store called \"winget\", but for now, the most commonly used package manager is chocolatey.\nChocolatey makes installing new software as easy as choco install . Setting up chocolatey is a bit involved. Instructions are available on their website, and I'll tried to provide some added context here.\n\nHead to the Windows search bar and type in PowerShell; in the right-hand menu, click run as administrator.\nTo paste into PowerShell, with something already copied to your clipboard (highlight, CTRL+C) you simply right-click in the shell. Copy and paste the following command into PowerShell: Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))`\n\n\nWait for the command to complete.\n\nAnd you're finished!\n\nFrom here, we can install some really helpful tools that we can use in the command line.\n\n\n\nSoftware\nCommand\nWhy use it?\n\n\n\n\ngit\nchoco install git\nThe world's most popular version control software.\n\n\nWindows Terminal\nchoco install microsoft-windows-terminal\nA (new) terminal for Windows to allow you to interact with multiple shells, organize tabs, and more, in a friendly way.\n\n\ncURL\nchoco install curl\nA command line interface for interacting with APIs. More on this in the intermediate section!\n\n\nGNU make\nchoco install make\nA replacement for Linux's make, allowing you to use a given makefile.\n\n\n\nA birthday bash\n\nOnce you've installed Git on a Windows device, you also get access to git bash. There are other \"bashes\" (for example, through Cygwin or through WSL, which aren't covered here), but since we already know so much about PowerShell, git bash is more than sufficient. \nOpen git bash by searching \"bash\" in the Windows search bar and hitting enter.\nThe path\nAfter a while of using the command line, you'll start to notice we can almost \"add\" commands to it by installing certain applications. For example, if you install Python, a popular programming language, on your computer, you'll then be able to type python into your terminal, and your terminal won't throw an error. What gives?\nOn Windows, this is managed through a special variable called your PATH. It specifies a set of paths (such as C:\\Program Files\\Python) where executable programs can be found, such as python.exe. It effect, it gives you shortcuts to executable files than you can then access from your command line by just typing in their name. So, instead of typing out C:\\Program Files\\Python every time you'd like to run a Python program, you can simply just type python.\nThis is especially important because one of the most common errors you'll encounter in PowerShell is the following:\n\"The term '...' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.\"\n\nIf this happens, don't panic! Google is your friend here. Try searching \"add ... to PATH\" (replace \"...\" with the name of what you're trying to execute) and follow what comes up. Typically, choco will automatically add things to your path, so you won't have to worry about this. If you're sure you've already added it to your path and your still not working, you can refresh PowerShell by typing refreshenv.\nNext steps for Windows\nWant to go further with your Windows configuration? Check out these resources to learn how to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux, to run Linux right on your Windows machine, customize your terminal with fonts and pretty colors, create terminal aliases to save some key strokes, and more, with these resources:\nBetter terminal emulators (link)\n\"Terminal emulator\" is a common way of referring to programs that act as terminals, but are a bit fancier than a \"standard\" terminal. One common one has already been mentioned a few times: Windows Terminal. It's available for download from the Microsoft Store, and is a fantastic option. After it is installed, you also get access to the wt command, which allows you to launch into the Windows Terminal from anywhere. See all of Windows Terminal's features including adding panes, customizing the font, and more, here.\nAnother really popular choice is cmder, which is an extension of a different console emulator called ConEmu (short for console emulator, quite literally). Cmder provides a ton of really cool features that inspired Windows Terminal, such as tabs, the ability to add panes, and more. You can even use cmder within the Windows Terminal.\nCascadia Code (link)\nWith all of their recent additions to the developer workflow, Microsoft has also added a new font that works exceptionally well for software development. It's perfect for integration with the Windows Terminal, VS Code, and anywhere else you write code.\nScott Hanselman's Technical How To's (link)\nScott is a Microsoft software engineer, teacher, blogger, and YouTuber.

Perhaps the most relevant trick for programmers is creating \"aliases\", which are abbreviations to execute a certain script. For example, you could type mdc and PowerShell would move you into your Documents/ folder.\n"},"3-intermediate/apis-basics.html":{"url":"3-intermediate/apis-basics.html","title":"Basics of APIs","keywords":"","body":"What the heck is an API?\nThink of it as the language that two programs can use to talk to and make requests to one another.\n\n\"In other words, an API is the messenger that delivers your request to the provider that you’re requesting it from and then delivers the response back to you.\"\n\nIn fact, the entire web runs on APIs! Every time you visit a webpage, you're requesting information from a server and doing something with it. To make a post on Facebook, you make a request to Facebook's servers.\nThe basics\nWhat is a 'request' → a request for the server to perform some action on a resource. This can be retrieving user information, updating some data, etc. \nThe defacto way of communicating on the web is usually Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It's also why you see http:// or https:// in the URL of most websites. This protocol also defines a bunch of different types of requests that you can send! The two most common ones we will cover in this guide are the GET and POST methods. \nGET → retrieves specific data. (e.g. Load this webpage)\nPOST → sending data to a server (e.g. submitting a form)\nYou can find more about the others methods in some of the resources below.\n\nhttps://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http_methods.htm\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods\n\nNow, after you make a request, the server (if it's alive) should return you a response! The response should include a status code that tells you about the type of response you got. A common one that you might see is the 404, which tells you that the server couldn't find the thing you were asking for. Here are a few other pretty common categories:\n\n2xx → successful\n4xx → bad request\n5xx → server error\n\nIf you'd like some more detailed information on these status codes, this is a good resource: https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html\nHow/when to use them in a project\nGreat, so now that I know a little bit about how these APIs kind of work, how do I use them in my projects?\n"},"3-intermediate/apis-handson.html":{"url":"3-intermediate/apis-handson.html","title":"Getting hands-on","keywords":"","body":"Getting more hands-on with APIs\nCalling / Using an API\nWhen do I need to do this?\n\nYou need to request information to some external service (e.g. getting the current weather, fetching your facebook posts, etc.)\nYou need to communicate with a service someone else built (e.g. your teammate)\n\nThis is usually done through the aforementioned HTTP requests. Each language has a different way of making these requests. \nPython\nrequests library → https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/\nThis library makes it dead simple to make HTTP requests. If you have Python installed already, you can get this library by typing\npip install requests\n\nYou can then use requests in Python by importing it. \nimport requests\n\n# make a GET request to the GitHub API and store\n# the result in the variable r\nr = requests.get('https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests')\n\n# r.status_code will tell you the status of the request\nprint(r.status_code) \n# should print out '200'\n\n# you can then convert the actual body of the response into\n# a python readable form (a dictionary in this case)\nbody = r.json()\n\n# then you can get certain fields from the body\nprint(body[\"description\"]) \n# should print out 'A simple, yet elegant HTTP library.'\n\nJavaScript\nXMLHttpRequest → This is a built-in JavaScript object that lets you make HTTP requests in Vanilla JavaScript! Example usage is as follows,\n// create a function that tells JavaScript what to do\n// after receiving a response from the server\nfunction handleResponse () {\n    // create a 'response' variable that contains the response data\n    const response = this\n\n    // print out the status of the request\n    console.log(response.status)\n\n    // get the body of the request and parse into JSON \n    // (allows JavaScript to easily manipulate the data)\n    const body = JSON.parse(response.responseText)\n\n    // print out the description field again\n    console.log(body.description)\n}\n\n// create a new request object with the name 'r'\nconst r = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n// add an event listener so that we run 'handleResponse()' after the\n// request 'r' loads\nr.addEventListener(\"load\", handleResponse);\n\n// make the actual request to the resource using GET\nr.open(\"GET\", \"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests\");\nr.send();\n\nYou can learn more about XMLHttpRequest here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest\nAxios → Axios is a Promise-based alternative to XMLHttpRequest that works in Node.js too :)) I'm not going to go into too much detail but it is definitely a more clean and easier way to do HTTP requests in JavaScript if you don't mind using external libraries.

Both Python and JavaScript have frameworks that make it simple to do just that.

Basically, these are long strings that tell the API who you are so they know you have permission to access it. You can find more information on how to include the API key here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface_key\nHosting your API\nWhat do you do after you've made an API? You may have noticed that your API only lives on your local machine and that nobody else can use it! So, how do we expose our API to the internet? The easiest way to do this is to host our API on a third-party provider. Just to name a few, Heroku, Google Cloud (GCP), and Amazon Web Services (AWS) are all widely used. Below, we've provided some resources and starter guides for each of these to help you get your API onto the internet!\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/deployment\n"},"3-intermediate/software-development-lifecycle.html":{"url":"3-intermediate/software-development-lifecycle.html","title":"Software Development Lifecycle","keywords":"","body":"The Software Development Life Cycle\nIs there a general timeline people in the industry follow when developing their software project? Yes! The software development life cycle (SDLC) is commonly used as a guideline for what tasks need to be accomplished before the completion of a software project. There are many variations of the SDLC which depend on project complexity. There are several stages to this life cycle as shown below. This section will provide a brief summary of why people use SDLC, different types of SDLC, and what happens during each respective stage of development.\n\n\nImage from: https://datarob.com/essentials-software-development-life-cycle/\n\nAdvantages of SDLC\nThis is why you should consider using a software developement cycle!\n\noverarching control over software development process\nimproves resource management and cost-effectiveness\nprovides clear action plan → increases transparency\nimproves cooperation between participants\n\nStages of SDLC\nThere are 6 important stages to the SDLC:\n\nPlanning & Requirement Analysis\nproduct owner or senior members of the team conducts preliminary analysis to discover aims and issues of the client\nplanning for quality assurance requirements and identification of risks\nteam proposes set of solutions with a budget and risks for each solution\n\n\nDefining Requirements\nclearly define and document a specification of requirements based on solution the client has chosen (Software Requirement Specification aka SRS)\nteam analyses documents related to project and evaluates the client's existing ecosystem\n\n\nDesigning Product Architecture\ncreate several product architecture diagrams based on SRS for client to choose from\nchosen architecture finalized in Design Document Specification (DDS) and evaluated in terms of risks, operation reliability, universality, and cost-effectiveness\nDDS reviewed by all stakeholders\n\n\nImplementation/Development\nprogramming code is developed as per DDS by developers\ndevelopment takes majority of the life cycle\nproduct may change during this stage\n\n\nTesting & Integration\nquality assurance engineers (QA) test product for bugs\ntesting should be throughout all stages of the life cycle\nspecifically in this stage, product defects are reports, tracked, fixed, and retested until meeting standards in SRS\n\n\nDeployment & Maintenance\nproduct is released to appropriate market\nproduct may first be released in limited segment and tested in real business environment\nbased on feedback, may e released as is or with suggested enhancements in targeting market segment\nmaintenance is done for existing customer base\n\n\n\nTypes of SDLC\nThere are also 6 types of SDLC that the industry uses: Agile, Iterative, Spiral, Waterfall, V-Shaped, and Big Bang. You might be wondering, \"what even????\". Below provides a brief overview of each type of SDLC. Agile is currently one of the most popular types of SDLC used in the tech industry so make sure to read up on at least that part for a starter! If you ever try interviewing for a technical position at a software company, knowing how the Agile model, specifically scrum, works are lots of brownie points!\n✨ Agile Model\nWhat is Agile?\n\nmethodology for modeling and documenting software systems\nmany current firms have implemented the agile model\nallows for fast adjustments\nuses Scrum and XP approaches\n\nWhat is scrum?\n\ngoal of delivering new software capability every 2-4 weeks\nemphasis in information transparency within the team\nfrequent inspections to detect variances and make adjustments early\n\nThere are many different components that make up Agile Scrum Development:\nScrum Team\n\nProduct Owner\nproject's key stakeholder (usually internal or external customer)\nonly one product owner\nconveys mission and vision of product\naccountable for managing product backlog and accepting completed increments of work\n\n\nScrumMaster\nFacilitator\nensures team adheres to Scrum theory, practice and rules\nremoves impediments, facilitates meetings, and helps Product Owner with backlog\n\n\nDevelopment Team\nself-organizing and cross-functional group\nanyone who participates in the creation of the delivered increment\nno titles in the development team (no hierarchy)\n\n\n\nScrum Events\nA lot of different events make up the entire scrum process.

There are many different databases for each need but we will focus on the two main categories, relational and non-relational.\nRelational Databases\nStructure\nRelational databases are table-based, you can think of them kind of like a more powerful excel spreadsheet! They are called relational because you can define relationships between different tables. For example, each customer could have an ID and each order would have the ID of the customer who it belonged to:\n\nFor relational databases, the schema must be predefined, which provides a rigid structure where you can specify constraints. For example, you could ensure that a column like order amount must be positive doubles only, which can help to keep data consistent.\nThey also tend to follow the ACID model, which is super important for data validity:\n\nAtomicity: All the changes are performed or none of them are. Partial updates to the database can cause future inconsistencies so instead, rejecting the whole transaction is favoured.\nConsistency: Changes must lead to a valid state, maintaining database invariants or rules. This prevents database corruption by an illegal transaction.\nIsolation: Ensures that if the changes were done concurrently, you would get the same result as doing them sequentially.\nDurability: After a transaction completes successfully, these changes are persisted, even if the system containing the data were to fail or crash.\n\nLanguage\nMost relational databases use the same structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data. SQL follows the declarative programming paradigm, which means you describe what needs to be done, not how to get it done. In turn, this allows for more complex queries on data.\nScalability\nIn general, relational databases are vertically scalable. This means that you scale by adding more power to one machine (CPU, RAM, SSD).\nDownsides\nSQL can be restrictive in the sense that it requires that you use predefined schemas to determine the structure of your data before you work with it. This means that future changes in the structure are more difficult and can be disruptive to your system. Additionally, with the increasing prevalence of cloud computing, being vertically scalable can be seen as a downside since you can only increase the power of one machine so much.\nNon-Relational Databases\nStructure\nNon-relational databases are quite literally not relational, they aren't in a strict table format and are described as not only SQL (NoSQL). This is because they were made to address the limitations of relational databases, especially in big data and real-time web applications.\nThey are usually in the following formats but the common theme is that they have dynamic schemas for unstructured data, which leads to more flexibility:\n\nDocument: JSON documents, so you can think of them as objects in OOP.\nKey-value: 1:1 relation between keys and values where keys are unique.\nGraph: In the sense of the computer science data structure with nodes and edges.\nWide-column: Tables with rows and dynamic columns, kind of like a 2D key-value store.\n\nNon-relational databases also tend to follow the BASE model, which favours availability over consistency. Where ACID ensures that data is always consistent, BASE ensures that data will be consistent at some time in the future:\n\nBasically Available: Basic operations are available as much as possible without any kind of consistency guarantees.\nSoft state: After some amount of time, we only have some probability of knowing the state. This means that stores don't have to be write-consistent and that replicas of the store do not have to be mutually consistent.\nEventually consistent: We will eventually be able to know what the state of the database is, and so any further reads will be consistent with our expectations.\n\nLanguage\nUnlike relational databases, there is no single query language for non-relational databases. Since you can create documents without having to first define their structure, each document can have its own unique structure and the syntax can vary from database to database.\nScalability\nNon-relational databases are often horizontally scalable. This means that you can scale by adding more servers, which is often cheaper. In general, this means having a distributed database with many small servers as opposed to one big server.\nDownsides\nMore flexibility isn't always a good thing since you have fewer guarantees about your data, and depending on the use case, this could be important. This relates to less consistency due to not having full ACID transactions.\nConclusion\nAs with everything in computer science, there are tradeoffs with each choice of database. Ultimately, the choice between relational and non-relational is not a total dichotomy. It is more like a spectrum from flexibility and availability to rigidness and consistency where plenty of databases exist in the middle but cannot truly guarantee either. Your choice will always depend on your use case!\nGetting Started\nSQL\nBeginner SQL Tutorial: Learn SQL Basics While Analyzing Bike-Sharing\n\nI found this tutorial to be pretty good for getting started quickly, it uses python with SQLite to teach the basics of SQL queries and relational data.\n\nLearn PostgreSQL Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners\n\nYou should check this out if you want an even more comprehensive guide.

They probably range from non-essential services like Facebook and Reddit, to much more important ones such as banking and education. Regardless of what you signed up for, it's a guarantee that your personal information has been stored somewhere. And it doesn't just stop with registration data. Sports teams keep track of player statistics, shops record daily transactions, there are infinite possibilities with the kinds of data we might want to save for future access and analysis. As you might have guessed, the most effective storage medium used to accomplish this are databases.\nWhat is a database?\nAt its core, a database is simply an organized collection of data. It may come as a surprise, but databases don't need to be stored on hardware to be classified as one. Physical paper-based databases are definitely a thing and were much more common in the past (e.g. phonebooks, ledgers). What really defines a database is the fact that the data is kept in a organized manner, and not just scribbled down without any structure. \nFor example, consider this email. Would you classify the included meeting data as organized? \n\n  \n\n\nProbably not. Even though the information is useful, it's not really organized at all. However if we extracted the data and formatted it into a table...\n\n  \n\n\nSeems pretty organized to me! This could be labeled as a valid database ✅\nHow about something like an Excel spreadsheet then? Going by our original definition, you could definitely identify a well organized spreadsheet as a database. However, we are tech folk! When we talk and think about databases, we probably aren't visualizing Excel or Google Sheets. The databases we mull over are a lot more than just simple data containers. They should support efficient queries. They should keep the data clean. They should be secure. All these critical features aren't available with databases alone. We need to include an extra piece in our database mental model with Database Management Systems. \nDatabase Management Systems (DBMS)\nA DBMS is a type of software that allows users and applications to interact with one or more databases. The databases themselves hold the actual data while the DBMS surrounds them and enforces rules that address important data maintenance issues, such as data integrity and security. Together, databases and DBMS' are known as database systems, and is actually what most people are alluding to when they talk about \"databases\".\n\n  \n\n\nFor the rest of the article we'll also be using the word \"database\" to refer to database systems, so keep that in mind!\nWhy do we need databases?\nSo far we've briefly touched on some of the benefits databases bring to the table. But what specifically separates a database from other storage mediums like spreadsheets? Here are some of the main reasons we love databases!\n\nEfficient Storage: Databases are able to store an enormous number of records in very little space. Spreadsheets however do not have the same storage optimizations.\n\nEfficient Operations: Databases are optimized to make operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting data very quick. Spreadsheets are otherwise likely to require much more time and effort to accomplish the same tasks.\n\nData Integrity: Data integrity describes the accuracy and consistency of your data. One of the most prevalent issues with using spreadsheets is how easy it is to make mistakes when creating, updating, and deleting data. Imagine entering names into a spreadsheet containing employee information. If you were careless, you might accidentally enter someone's name twice, or even write their date of birth instead. \n\n  \n\n\nA spreadsheet doesn't prevent you from making these mistakes, but databases can! Databases are capable of validating the integrity of the data, through the specification of a schema. You can think of a schema as a blueprint that outlines constraints that the stored data must adhere to, resulting in much less redundant, missing, and incorrect information.\n\nSafe Concurrent Access: When multiple users are simultaneously accessing a database, the database ensures that each user's operations don't interfere with one another. On the other hand, spreadsheets give no guarantee of such safety. Imagine hundreds of users accidentally overwriting each others changes on a spreadsheet. The result could be potentially disastrous with cases of inconsistent or missing data. \n\nSecurity: Databases make it much safer to deal with sensitive data. Users can be given different permissions that determine what kinds of database operations they're allowed to conduct. You don't necessarily want all users to have complete control over a database, and you definitely don't want to risk exposing private information to the public.\n\n\nConclusion\nNow that you have an idea of what databases are, the difference between databases and DBMS, and why we use databases, we can look more deeply into the different types of databases that exist.
